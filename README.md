# Implementation of the Monkey language in Golang

## Tests
Run the tests to ensure all packages are working as expected:
```go
// Test Framework: gotest
// Test kind: Directory
go test ./... // to run tests on all packages at once
```

## Run
Start the Interpreter with your local go environment to test it out:
```go
go run main.go
```
Only some main concepts of a programming language are implemented. Don't expect list comprehension here :)
